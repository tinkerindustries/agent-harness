# Models & Pricing

The prices listed below are in units of per 1M tokens. A token, the smallest unit of text that the model recognizes, can be a word, a number, or even a punctuation mark. We will bill based on the total number of input and output tokens by the model.

(1) The Responses API currently only supports the `deepseek-v4-flash` model, and does not yet support the `deepseek-v4-pro` model. We will add support for the `deepseek-v4-pro` model in early August 2026.

(2) We plan to raise the overall pricing for DeepSeek API services in the near future, with a significant increase expected. Please plan your usage accordingly. The specific pricing plan will be subject to official notice.

## Deduction Rules

The expense = number of tokens × price.
The corresponding fees will be directly deducted from your topped-up balance or granted balance, with a preference for using the granted balance first when both balances are available.

Product prices may vary and DeepSeek reserves the right to adjust them. We recommend topping up based on your actual usage and regularly checking this page for the most recent pricing information.
