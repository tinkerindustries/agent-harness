# Common Error Codes

When a request fails, the API returns a JSON response that contains error information:

```json theme={null}
{
    "error": {
        "type": "content_filter",
        "message": "The request was rejected because it was considered high risk"
    }
}
```

## Error List

## 400 — Bad Request

| error type              | Typical message                                                                       | Cause and fix                                                                                                             |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `content_filter`        | The request was rejected because it was considered high risk                          | The input or model output triggered content safety review. Modify the prompt and avoid sensitive or high-risk content.    |
| `invalid_request_error` | Request format error, missing required parameter, or invalid parameter type           | Check the request body against the API documentation.                                                                     |
| `invalid_request_error` | Input token length too long                                                           | The input tokens exceed the model's maximum context limit. Shorten the input or use a model with a larger context window. |
| `invalid_request_error` | prompt tokens + max\_tokens exceeds the model specification                           | Reduce `max_tokens` or switch to another model.                                                                           |
| `invalid_request_error` | Invalid purpose: only 'file-extract' accepted                                         | The `purpose` field for file upload is incorrect. Currently, only `file-extract` is supported.                            |
| `invalid_request_error` | File size is too large, max file size is 100MB, please confirm and re-upload the file | The uploaded file exceeds the 100MB limit. Compress or split the file and upload it again.                                |
| `invalid_request_error` | File size is zero, please confirm and re-upload the file                              | The uploaded file size is 0. Check whether the file is corrupted or empty.                                                |
| `invalid_request_error` | Too many uploaded files                                                               | The total number of uploaded files exceeds the limit. Delete earlier files that are no longer used, then try again.       |

## 401 — Authentication Error

| error type                     | Typical message            | Cause and fix                                                             |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `invalid_authentication_error` | Invalid Authentication     | The API key is invalid or malformed. Check `Authorization: Bearer <key>`. |
| `incorrect_api_key_error`      | Incorrect API key provided | The API key was not provided, or the key is incorrect.                    |

**Platform key isolation**: Keys issued on `platform.kimi.ai` are independent from keys issued on other regional Kimi platforms. Mixing keys across platforms returns 401. Make sure the endpoint matches the platform where the key was created.

## 403 — Permission Error

| error type                | Typical message                                    | Cause and fix                                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `permission_denied_error` | The API you are accessing is not open              | This API is not currently available to your account.                                                                                         |
| `permission_denied_error` | You are not allowed to get other user info         | You are not allowed to access other users' information. Check the permission scope for the API.                                              |
| `permission_denied_error` | Your IP is not allowed to access this organization | The calling IP is not in the organization's allowlist. This is common on the international platform. Contact an administrator to add the IP. |

## 404 — Resource Not Found

| error type                 | Typical message                                                               | Cause and fix                                                     |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `resource_not_found_error` | Model not found, or this account does not have permission to access the model | Check the spelling of the `model` parameter and the account tier. |

## 429 — Rate Limit / Insufficient Quota

| error type                     | Typical message                                                  | Cause and fix                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `engine_overloaded_error`      | The engine is currently overloaded, please try again later       | The service node is under high load (for example, peak-hour capacity pressure). Wait as indicated by `Retry-After`, reduce concurrency, and retry with exponential backoff. This is caused by server-side capacity; topping up or upgrading your tier does not resolve it. |
| `exceeded_current_quota_error` | Account balance is insufficient or the account has been disabled | Check your balance and billing status.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `exceeded_current_quota_error` | Token quota is insufficient                                      | Top up your account and try again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `rate_limit_reached_error`     | Organization-level concurrency limit reached                     | Reduce concurrency or retry after the time indicated in the response.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `rate_limit_reached_error`     | Organization-level RPM limit reached                             | Retry after waiting for the time indicated in the response. RPM means requests per minute.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `rate_limit_reached_error`     | Organization-level TPM limit reached                             | Reduce request frequency or upgrade your tier. TPM means tokens per minute.                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `rate_limit_reached_error`     | Organization-level TPD limit reached                             | The limit will reset the next day, or you can upgrade your plan. TPD means tokens per day.                                                                                                                                                                                 |

## 499 / 500 / 503 / 504 — Connection And Server Errors

| HTTP | error type                           | Cause and fix                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ---- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 499  | `client_closed_request`              | The client disconnected before the server returned a response. This is common when a streaming response is cut off by an intermediate proxy or when the user cancels the request. Check KeepAlive and timeout settings. |
| 500  | `server_error` / `unexpected_output` | Internal server error. Try again later. If the issue persists, contact support with the `request_id`.                                                                                                                   |
| 503  | `server_unavailable`                 | The service is temporarily unavailable. Try again later. This is usually related to node scaling or maintenance.                                                                                                        |
| 504  | `504 Gateway Time-out`               | No response from the server for 900 seconds; the gateway returns an HTML timeout page. Common with long non-streaming requests. Use streaming output (`stream: true`).                                                  |

## Troubleshooting Tips

* **401 response**: First confirm that you are using an API key from the correct platform.
* **429 response**: First identify the cause by `error.type`: back off and retry for node overload, reduce concurrency or upgrade your account tier for organization-level rate limits, and top up for insufficient balance. See [Top-up and Rate Limits](../pricing/limits.md).
* **500 response**: Try again later. If the issue persists, contact the support team at [api-service@moonshot.ai](mailto:api-service@moonshot.ai).
* **504 response**: The gateway timed out because the server produced no response for 900 seconds. Use streaming output (`stream: true`).
