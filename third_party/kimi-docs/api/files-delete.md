# Delete File

> Deletes a previously uploaded file.

Deletes a previously uploaded file. Once deleted, the file no longer counts against your storage quota and cannot be used in chat completions or Batch requests.

<Accordion title="Usage Example">
  <Tabs>
    <Tab title="python">

      client = OpenAI(
          api_key=os.environ.get("MOONSHOT_API_KEY"),
          base_url="https://api.moonshot.ai/v1",
      )

      # Delete a specific file
      delete_result = client.files.delete(file_id="file-xxx")
      print(delete_result)
      ```

          apiKey: process.env.MOONSHOT_API_KEY,
          baseURL: "https://api.moonshot.ai/v1",
      });

      async function main() {
          const deleteResult = await client.files.delete({
              file_id: "file-xxx",
          });
          console.log(deleteResult);
      }

      main();
      ```
    </Tab>
  </Tabs>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Response Fields">
  The delete file endpoint returns a JSON object with the following fields:

  | Field     | Type    | Description                               |
  | --------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------- |
  | `id`      | string  | Deleted file identifier                   |
  | `object`  | string  | Always `"file"`                           |
  | `deleted` | boolean | Whether the file was deleted successfully |

  **Response Example**

  ```json theme={null}
  {
      "id": "file-xxx",
      "object": "file",
      "deleted": true
  }
  ```
</Accordion>

<Note>
  Deletion is permanent. Each user can upload a maximum of 1,000 files. When the total file count reaches the limit, you must delete unused files before uploading new ones.
</Note>

<Warning>
  If the file does not exist or has already been deleted, the endpoint returns a `404` error. Please verify that the `file_id` is correct.
</Warning>
