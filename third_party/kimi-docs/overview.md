# Quickstart

> Create an API Key and complete your first Kimi API call.

Kimi API lets you interact with Kimi models and is compatible with the OpenAI API format. Prepare an API Key, choose a model, and configure `base_url` to make requests through the HTTP API, Python SDK, or Node.js SDK.

<Info>
  [Kimi K3](guide/kimi-k3-quickstart.md) is now officially available — Kimi's most capable model to date, with a 1M-token context window and native visual understanding. It is well suited for programming agent scenarios such as [Claude Code](guide/claude-code-kimi.md), as well as knowledge work and deep reasoning.
</Info>

## Get started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get an API Key">
    Visit the [Kimi API Platform](https://platform.kimi.ai/), sign in, then go to [API Keys](https://platform.kimi.ai/console/api-keys) to create and copy an API Key.

    Keep your API Key secure. Do not share it with others or hard-code it directly in your application. We recommend storing it in an environment variable:

    ```bash theme={null}
    export MOONSHOT_API_KEY="YOUR_KIMI_API_KEY"
    ```

    <CardGroup cols={2}>
      <Card title="Kimi API Platform" icon="link" href="https://platform.kimi.ai/">
        Sign in to the platform to access the console, development workspace, and user center.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose a model">
    For a quickstart, we recommend starting with Kimi K3; you can also choose Kimi K2.7 Code or Kimi K2.6 for specific scenarios.

      <Card title="Kimi K3" icon="rocket" href="/docs/guide/kimi-k3-quickstart">
        Kimi K3 is our flagship model for long-horizon coding and end-to-end knowledge work — 2.8 trillion parameters, a 1M-token context window, and industry-leading intelligence.
      </Card>

      <Card title="Kimi K2.7 Code" icon="code" href="/docs/guide/kimi-k2-7-code-quickstart">
        A coding-focused model with a 256K context window, text/image/video input, and thinking mode. Choose `kimi-k2.7-code-highspeed` when you need higher output speed.
      </Card>

      <Card title="Kimi K2.6" icon="brain" href="/docs/guide/kimi-k2-6-quickstart">
        A powerful general-purpose model with a 256K context window, text/image/video input, and both thinking and non-thinking modes. Use it for general chat, agent tasks, visual understanding, and complex reasoning.
      </Card>
    </CardGroup>

    <Tip>
      If you are not sure which model to choose, start with `kimi-k3`. If your task is mainly code generation, code editing, or programming agents and you need higher output speed, choose `kimi-k2.7-code-highspeed`.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose an integration method">
    Kimi API is compatible with the OpenAI API format, so you can choose the integration method that best fits your technology stack.

    </CardGroup>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Make your first call">
    The following examples use the Kimi K3 model. Replace `MOONSHOT_API_KEY` with the API Key you created on the platform, or set an environment variable with the same name before running the examples.

    <Note>
      The examples on this page use the latest model `kimi-k3` by default. K3 configures reasoning effort with the top-level `reasoning_effort` request field (supports `"low"` / `"high"` / `"max"`, default `"max"`). To use another model such as `kimi-k2.6` or `kimi-k2.5`, just replace the `model` field — parameter configurations differ across models. See the [Model Parameter Reference](api/models-overview.md).
    </Note>

    <Tip>
      To use the high-speed model for coding scenarios, replace `kimi-k3` in the examples with `kimi-k2.7-code-highspeed`; to call Kimi K2.6, replace it with `kimi-k2.6`.

    Before running the examples, prepare:

    1. Python 3.8 or later, or Node.js 18 or later.
    2. OpenAI SDK 1.0.0 or later. Kimi API is compatible with the OpenAI API format, so you can call Kimi directly with the OpenAI Python or Node.js SDK.
       ```text theme={null}
       pip install --upgrade 'openai>=1.0' # Python
       npm install openai@latest # Node.js
       ```
    3. An API Key. Create an API Key in the [Kimi API Platform](https://platform.kimi.ai/console/api-keys), then pass it to the `OpenAI Client` so the platform can identify your account.

    If the code runs successfully without errors, you will see output similar to:

    ```text theme={null}
    Hello, Li Lei! 1+1 equals 2. This is a basic arithmetic question. If you have any other questions or need help, feel free to let me know.
    ```

    *Note: Because Kimi models are nondeterministic, the actual response may not exactly match the example above.*
