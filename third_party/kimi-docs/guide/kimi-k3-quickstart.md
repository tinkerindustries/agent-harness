# Kimi K3

## Introducing Kimi K3

Kimi K3 is Kimi's most capable flagship model to date, with 2.8 trillion parameters. It is built on Kimi Delta Attention (KDA), a hybrid linear attention mechanism, and Attention Residuals, with native visual understanding and a 1M-token context window. It is the world's first open-source model in the 3-trillion-parameter class, designed for frontier intelligence scenarios including long-horizon coding, knowledge work, and reasoning.

For complete benchmarks and case studies, see the [technical blog](https://www.kimi.com/blog/kimi-k3). Kimi is currently working closely with inference partners and open-source maintainers to align technical details and ensure the model launches reliably across the ecosystem. The full model weights will be released by July 27, 2026. More details on architecture, training, and evaluation will be published with the Kimi K3 technical report.

### A 3-trillion-scale open-source model

Kimi K3 is the first open-source model to reach 2.8 trillion parameters. This is the latest step in Kimi's continued push of model-scale boundaries: in 9 of the past 12 months (2025/07–2026/07), Kimi models have maintained the frontier in open-source model scale.

Kimi K3 is built on Kimi Delta Attention (KDA) and Attention Residuals (AttnRes). Both architectural updates are designed to help information flow more smoothly through longer sequences and deeper models. We also further increased the sparsity of the Mixture of Experts (MoE): with the Stable LatentMoE framework, the model efficiently activates 16 out of 896 experts. Together with improvements in training methodology and data recipes, these structural advances give Kimi K3 roughly 2.5x the overall scaling efficiency of K2, converting compute into capability more effectively.

### Coding

Kimi K3 has strong long-horizon coding capabilities. With minimal human supervision, it can sustain long-running engineering tasks, understand and work with large codebases, and coordinate terminal tools.

Kimi K3 also excels at tasks that combine software engineering and visual reasoning. It can use screenshots and visual feedback to improve workflows in game development, frontend engineering, CAD, and related scenarios.

### Knowledge work

Kimi K3 advances end-to-end knowledge work. Beyond public benchmarks, Kimi K3 (max) also shows consistent gains in our internal evaluations. These evaluations reflect recurring task patterns and challenges from real user-agent collaboration workflows. Kimi K3 demonstrates consistent advantages across production-oriented workflows, indicating broad improvements in agentic knowledge-work capabilities.

## Access requirements

Kimi K3 is a flagship model: it is unlocked after a successful top-up (minimum \$1). Your cumulative top-up amount also determines your account tier and rate limits (concurrency, RPM, TPM, TPD) — see [Recharge and Rate Limits](../pricing/limits.md).

## Get started

* [Playground](https://platform.kimi.ai/playground)
* [Get an API Key](https://platform.kimi.ai/console/api-keys)

The examples require Python 3.9+ and the OpenAI SDK. Install the SDK and initialize the client once; later Python examples reuse `client`.

```bash theme={null}
python3 -m pip install --upgrade 'openai>=1.0'
```

```python theme={null}
import os

from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    api_key=os.environ["MOONSHOT_API_KEY"],
    base_url="https://api.moonshot.ai/v1",
)
```

## Basic call

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Python">
    ```python theme={null}
    completion = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="kimi-k3",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Introduce Kimi K3 in one sentence."}],
    )

    print(completion.choices[0].message.content)
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="cURL">
    ```bash theme={null}
    curl https://api.moonshot.ai/v1/chat/completions \
      --header "Authorization: Bearer $MOONSHOT_API_KEY" \
      --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
      --data '{
        "model": "kimi-k3",
        "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Introduce Kimi K3 in one sentence."}]
      }'
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Reasoning effort

K3 always has thinking mode enabled and supports configuring its reasoning effort with the top-level `reasoning_effort` request field.

<Note>
  Reasoning effort supports `low`, `high`, and `max` (default `max`). See [Reasoning Effort](use-reasoning-effort.md) for usage.
</Note>

```python theme={null}
completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="kimi-k3",
    reasoning_effort="max",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Prove that the square root of 2 is irrational."}],
)

print(completion.choices[0].message.content)
```

<Note>
  For multi-turn conversations and tool calls, add the complete assistant message returned by the API to the next request. Do not keep only `content`.
</Note>

## Streaming

Streaming responses provide separate `reasoning_content` and final-answer `content` deltas. See [Streaming Output](utilize-the-streaming-output-feature-of-kimi-api.md) for details.

```python theme={null}
stream = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="kimi-k3",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Explain why the sky is blue."}],
    stream=True,
)

for chunk in stream:
    delta = chunk.choices[0].delta
    reasoning = getattr(delta, "reasoning_content", None)
    if reasoning:
        print(reasoning, end="", flush=True)
    if delta.content:
        print(delta.content, end="", flush=True)
```

## Vision input

For vision messages, `content` must be an array of objects, not a serialized string. See [Vision Input](use-kimi-vision-model.md) for formats and limits.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Local image">
    ```python theme={null}
    import base64
    from pathlib import Path

    image_data: str = base64.b64encode(Path("image.png").read_bytes()).decode()
    completion = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="kimi-k3",
        messages=[
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": [
                    {
                        "type": "image_url",
                        "image_url": {"url": f"data:image/png;base64,{image_data}"},
                    },
                    {"type": "text", "text": "Describe this image."},
                ],
            }
        ],
    )

    print(completion.choices[0].message.content)
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Video file">
    ```python theme={null}
    from pathlib import Path

    video = client.files.create(file=Path("video.mp4"), purpose="video")
    try:
        completion = client.chat.completions.create(
            model="kimi-k3",
            messages=[
                {
                    "role": "user",
                    "content": [
                        {
                            "type": "video_url",
                            "video_url": {"url": f"ms://{video.id}"},
                        },
                        {"type": "text", "text": "Summarize this video."},
                    ],
                }
            ],
        )
        print(completion.choices[0].message.content)
    finally:
        client.files.delete(video.id)
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Structured output

Use `json_schema` with `strict: true` to constrain the final `message.content`. Parse only that field, not `reasoning_content`.

<Accordion title="Name and age schema">
  ```python theme={null}
  import json

  completion = client.chat.completions.create(
      model="kimi-k3",
      messages=[
          {"role": "user", "content": "Lin is 28 years old. Extract the name and age."}
      ],
      response_format={
          "type": "json_schema",
          "json_schema": {
              "name": "person",
              "strict": True,
              "schema": {
                  "type": "object",
                  "properties": {
                      "name": {"type": "string"},
                      "age": {"type": "integer"},
                  },
                  "required": ["name", "age"],
                  "additionalProperties": False,
              },
          },
      },
  )

  person: dict[str, object] = json.loads(
      completion.choices[0].message.content or "{}"
  )
  print(person)
  ```
</Accordion>

See [Structured Output](response_format.md).

## Partial Mode

Add an assistant message with `partial=True` at the end of `messages` to continue from a text prefix. Prepend that prefix when displaying the final result.

```python theme={null}
prefix: str = "Conclusion: "
completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="kimi-k3",
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "In one sentence, explain why API compatibility matters."},
        {"role": "assistant", "content": prefix, "partial": True},
    ],
)

print(prefix + (completion.choices[0].message.content or ""))
```

See [Partial Mode](use-partial-mode-feature-of-kimi-api.md).

## Custom tools and `tool_choice`

Use `tool_choice="required"` on the first turn to require at least one tool call. After executing every call, return the complete assistant message and append one tool result with the matching `tool_call_id` for each call.

<Accordion title="Minimal weather agent loop">
  ```python theme={null}
  import json
  from typing import Any

  tools: list[dict[str, Any]] = [
      {
          "type": "function",
          "function": {
              "name": "get_weather",
              "description": "Get the weather for a city",
              "parameters": {
                  "type": "object",
                  "properties": {"city": {"type": "string"}},
                  "required": ["city"],
              },
          },
      }
  ]
  messages: list[Any] = [
      {"role": "user", "content": "What is the weather in San Francisco today?"}
  ]

  first = client.chat.completions.create(
      model="kimi-k3",
      messages=messages,
      tools=tools,
      tool_choice="required",
  )
  assistant_message = first.choices[0].message
  messages.append(assistant_message)

  for tool_call in assistant_message.tool_calls or []:
      arguments: dict[str, str] = json.loads(tool_call.function.arguments)
      result: str = json.dumps(
          {"city": arguments["city"], "weather": "sunny", "temperature_c": 24}
      )
      messages.append(
          {"role": "tool", "tool_call_id": tool_call.id, "content": result}
      )

  final = client.chat.completions.create(
      model="kimi-k3",
      messages=messages,
      tools=tools,
  )
  print(final.choices[0].message.content)
  ```
</Accordion>

See [Tool Choice](use-tool-choice.md).

## Dynamic tool loading

Place a complete tool definition in a `system` message without `content`. The tool becomes available from that message onward.

<Accordion title="Load a calculator dynamically">
  ```python theme={null}
  from typing import Any

  dynamic_messages: list[dict[str, Any]] = [
      {"role": "user", "content": "Calculate 23 times 47."},
      {
          "role": "system",
          "tools": [
              {
                  "type": "function",
                  "function": {
                      "name": "calculate",
                      "description": "Evaluate an arithmetic expression",
                      "parameters": {
                          "type": "object",
                          "properties": {
                              "expression": {
                                  "type": "string",
                                  "description": "The arithmetic expression to evaluate",
                              }
                          },
                          "required": ["expression"],
                      },
                  },
              }
          ],
      },
  ]
  completion = client.chat.completions.create(
      model="kimi-k3",
      messages=dynamic_messages,
  )

  print(completion.choices[0].message.tool_calls)
  ```
</Accordion>

* Include the complete `name`, `description`, and `parameters` definition.
* The declaration takes effect at its position in `messages`.
* Keep this message in later request history; the server does not retain it.

See [Dynamic Tool Loading](use-dynamic-tool-loading.md).

## 1M context and automatic caching

<Note>
  A new request can hit the prefix cache only when the previous request's prompt tokens exceed 256. If the previous request's prompt tokens are below 256, the request is not cached and is discarded. See [Context Caching](use-context-caching-feature-of-kimi-api.md) for details.
</Note>

Context caching is automatic for regular model requests; no cache ID, TTL, or extra parameter is required. Keep the long prefix unchanged so later requests can automatically attempt a cache hit.

```python theme={null}
from pathlib import Path

knowledge: str = Path("knowledge-base.md").read_text(encoding="utf-8")

for question in ["Summarize the key conclusions.", "List three implementation risks."]:
    completion = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="kimi-k3",
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": knowledge},
            {"role": "user", "content": question},
        ],
    )
    print(completion.choices[0].message.content)
```

See [Context Caching](use-context-caching-feature-of-kimi-api.md).

## Official tools

Official tools are integrated through Formula:

1. Fetch tool definitions from the Formula `/tools` endpoint.
2. Add those definitions to the Chat Completions `tools` field.
3. When the model returns `tool_calls`, submit each function name and arguments to the Formula `/fibers` endpoint.
4. Add the complete assistant message and Fiber output as the corresponding tool message.
5. Call Chat Completions again until the model returns a final answer.

See [Official Tools](use-official-tools.md) for the complete client and API contract. Web search is being updated and is not recommended for use in the near term.

## Important limits

* Reasoning effort is configured with the top-level `reasoning_effort` request field and supports `low`, `high`, and `max` (default `max`); K3 always has thinking mode enabled.
* `max_completion_tokens` defaults to 131072 and can be set up to 1048576.
* `temperature=1.0`, `top_p=0.95`, `n=1`, `presence_penalty=0`, and `frequency_penalty=0` are fixed; omit them from requests.
* Return the complete assistant message unchanged in multi-turn conversations and tool calls.
* Vision input does not support public image URLs. Use base64 or `ms://<file-id>`, and make `content` an array of objects.
* Web search is being updated and is not recommended for production workflows in the near term.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How is Kimi K3 billed?">
    Kimi K3 offers a 1M-token context and uses flat pay-as-you-go pricing — there is no tiering by context length. Input (with separate rates for cache hits and misses) and output are billed at uniform per-token prices. See [Kimi K3 pricing](../pricing/chat-k3.md).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I turn off Kimi K3's chain-of-thought?">
    You can't — K3 always thinks. If the reasoning takes too long, set `reasoning_effort` to `low` to reduce the reasoning effort. See [Reasoning Effort](use-reasoning-effort.md).
  </Accordion>
