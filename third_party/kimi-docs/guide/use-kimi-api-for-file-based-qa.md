# Use Kimi API for File-Based Q&A

The Kimi intelligent assistant can upload files and answer questions based on those files. The Kimi API offers the same functionality. Below, we'll walk through a practical example of how to upload files and ask questions using the Kimi API:

<Note>
  The examples on this page use the latest model `kimi-k3` by default. K3 configures reasoning effort with the top-level `reasoning_effort` request field (supports `"low"` / `"high"` / `"max"`, default `"max"`). To use another model such as `kimi-k2.6` or `kimi-k2.5`, just replace the `model` field — parameter configurations differ across models. See the [Model Parameter Reference](../api/models-overview.md).

    )
     
    # 'moonshot.pdf' is an example file. We support text and image files. For image files, we provide OCR capabilities.
    # To upload a file, you can use the file upload API from the openai library. Create a file object using Path from the standard library pathlib and pass it to the file parameter. Set the purpose parameter to 'file-extract'. The file upload interface also supports other purpose values such as 'image' and 'video' (for native model understanding).
    file_object = client.files.create(file=Path("moonshot.pdf"), purpose="file-extract")

        console.log(completion.choices[0].message.content);    
    }
     
    main();
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Let's review the basic steps and considerations for file-based Q\&A:

1. Upload the file to the Kimi server using the `/v1/files` interface or the `files.create` API in the SDK;
2. Retrieve the file content using the `/v1/files/{file_id}` interface or the `files.content` API in the SDK. The retrieved content is already formatted in a way that our recommended model can easily understand;
3. Place the extracted (and formatted) file content (not the file `id`) in the messages list as a system prompt;
4. Start asking questions about the file content;

**Note again: Place the file content in the prompt, not the file `id`.**

## Q\&A on Multiple Files

If you want to ask questions based on multiple files, it's quite simple. **Just place each file in a separate system prompt.** Here's how you can do it in code:

        :param files: A list of file paths to be uploaded. The paths can be absolute or relative, and should be passed as strings.

## Best Practices for File Management

In general, the file upload and extraction features are designed to convert files of various formats into a format that our recommended model can easily understand. After completing the file upload and extraction steps, the extracted content can be stored locally. In the next file-based Q\&A request, there is no need to upload and extract the files again.

Since we have limited the number of files a single user can upload (up to 1000 files per user), we suggest that you regularly clean up the uploaded files after the extraction process is complete. You can periodically run the following code to clean up the uploaded files:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="python">
    ```python theme={null}
    import os
    from openai import OpenAI
     
    client = OpenAI(
        api_key=os.environ["MOONSHOT_API_KEY"], # Set the MOONSHOT_API_KEY environment variable before running this example
        base_url="https://api.moonshot.ai/v1",
    )

    file_list = client.files.list()
     
    for file in file_list.data:
    	client.files.delete(file_id=file.id)
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="node.js">
    ```js theme={null}
    const OpenAI = require("openai")
     
    const client = new OpenAI({
        apiKey: process.env.MOONSHOT_API_KEY, // Set the MOONSHOT_API_KEY environment variable before running this example
        baseURL: "https://api.moonshot.ai/v1",
    })

    async function main() {
        const file_list = await client.files.list()
     
        for (file of file_list.data) {
            await client.files.delete(file_id=file.id)
        }
    }

    main()
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

In the code above, we first list all the file details using the `files.list` API and then delete each file using the `files.delete` API. Regularly performing this operation ensures that file storage space is released, allowing subsequent file uploads and extractions to be successful.
