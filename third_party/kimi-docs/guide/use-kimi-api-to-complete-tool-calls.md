# Use Kimi API for Tool Calls

Tool calls (`tool_calls`) let the Kimi large language model go beyond "talking" to "doing": the model decides whether to call a tool based on the conversation context, generates the call arguments in JSON, and your application executes the tool and returns the result so the model can produce the final reply. With `tool_calls`, the Kimi large language model can help you search the internet, query databases, and even control smart home devices. This page walks through the full flow — defining, registering, and executing tools — with an internet-search example, plus notes for streaming and other scenarios.

## The Complete Flow of a Tool Call

A tool call involves the following steps:

1. Define the tool using JSON Schema format;
2. Submit the defined tool to the Kimi large language model via the `tools` parameter. You can submit multiple tools at once;
3. The Kimi large language model will decide which tool(s) to use based on the context of the current conversation. It can also choose not to use any tools;
4. The Kimi large language model will output the parameters and information needed to call the tool in JSON format;
5. Use the parameters output by the Kimi large language model to execute the corresponding tool and submit the results back to the Kimi large language model;
6. The Kimi large language model will respond to the user based on the results of the tool execution;

<Tip>
  If your application needs a large tool inventory (dozens or hundreds of tools), use [Dynamically Loaded Tools](use-dynamic-tool-loading.md) to inject tool definitions on demand instead of submitting them all at once — this significantly reduces token usage and improves tool-selection accuracy.
</Tip>

## Give the Model Internet Access with Tool Calls

The knowledge of the Kimi large language model comes from its training data, so it cannot answer time-sensitive questions from what it already knows. The example below uses two tools — a "search engine" and a "web browser" — to show how the model can search for the latest information and answer based on it.

### Define Tools with JSON Schema

When people look up information online, they usually open a search engine (such as Baidu or Bing), browse the search results, and then open one or more result pages to get the knowledge they need. Abstracting these two actions into tools gives us a "search engine" and a "web browser" — described in JSON Schema and submitted to the Kimi large language model, so it can search and browse the web just like humans do.

Tool definitions are written in JSON Schema format:

> [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) is a vocabulary that you can use to annotate and validate JSON documents.
>
> [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) is a JSON document used to describe the format of JSON data.

We define the following JSON Schema:

```json theme={null}
{
	"type": "object",
	"properties": {
		"name": {
			"type": "string"
		}
	}
}
```

This JSON Schema defines a JSON Object that contains a field named `name`, and the type of this field is `string`, for example:

```json theme={null}
{
	"name": "Hei"
}
```

By describing our tool definitions using JSON Schema, we can make it clearer and more intuitive for the Kimi large language model to understand what parameters our tools require, as well as the type and description of each parameter. Now let's define the "search engine" and "web browser" tools mentioned earlier:

When defining tools using JSON Schema, we use the following fixed format:

```json theme={null}
{
	"type": "function",
	"function": {
		"name": "NAME",
		"description": "DESCRIPTION",
		"parameters": {
			"type": "object",
			"properties": {
				
			}
		}
	}
}
```

Here, `name`, `description`, and `parameters.properties` are defined by the tool provider. The `description` explains the specific function and when to use the tool, while `parameters` outlines the specific parameters needed to successfully call the tool, including parameter types and descriptions. **Ultimately, the Kimi large language model will generate a JSON Object that meets the defined requirements as the parameters (arguments) for the tool call based on the JSON Schema.**

### Register the Tools with the Model

Submit the `search` tool to the Kimi large language model and see if it can call the tool correctly:

<Note>
  The examples on this page use the latest model `kimi-k3` by default. K3 configures reasoning effort with the top-level `reasoning_effort` request field (supports `"low"` / `"high"` / `"max"`, default `"max"`). To use another model such as `kimi-k2.6` or `kimi-k2.5`, just replace the `model` field — parameter configurations differ across models. See the [Model Parameter Reference](../api/models-overview.md).

When the above code runs successfully, we get the response from Kimi large language model:

```json theme={null}
{
    "finish_reason": "tool_calls",
    "message": {
        "content": "",
        "role": "assistant",
        "tool_calls": [
            {
                "id": "search:0",
                "function": {
                    "arguments": "{\n    \"query\": \"Context Caching\"\n}",
                    "name": "search"
                },
                "type": "function"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

Notice that in this response, the value of `finish_reason` is `tool_calls`, which means that the response is not the answer from Kimi large language model, but rather the tool that Kimi large language model has chosen to execute. You can determine whether the current response from Kimi large language model is a tool call `tool_calls` by checking the value of `finish_reason`.

At this point the `content` field in `message` is empty, because the model is executing `tool_calls` and has not yet generated a reply for the user. The newly added `tool_calls` field is a list containing all the tool call information for this turn — which shows that **the model can choose to call multiple tools at once, which can be different tools or the same tool with different parameters**. Each element in `tool_calls` represents one tool call: the Kimi large language model generates a unique `id` for each call, uses `function.name` to indicate the name of the tool function, and places the call parameters in `function.arguments` (`arguments` is a valid serialized JSON Object; additionally, the `type` parameter is currently a fixed value `function`).

Next, use the tool call parameters generated by the Kimi large language model to execute the corresponding tools.

### Execute the Tools and Return the Results

The Kimi large language model does not execute tools for you — once you receive the parameters it generates, your application must execute them. Why can't the model execute tools itself? Imagine a typical scenario: **you provide users with a smart robot based on the Kimi large language model. In this scenario, there are three roles: the user, the robot, and the Kimi large language model. The user asks the robot a question, the robot calls the Kimi large language model API, and returns the API result to the user. When using `tool_calls`, the user asks the robot a question, the robot calls the Kimi API with `tools`, the Kimi large language model returns the `tool_calls` parameters, the robot executes the `tool_calls`, submits the results back to the Kimi API, the Kimi large language model generates the message to be returned to the user (`finish_reason=stop`), and only then does the robot return the message to the user.** The entire `tool_calls` process is transparent and implicit to the user: users never directly "see" the tool calls, only the final reply presented by the robot.

The full example below executes the `tool_calls` returned by the Kimi large language model from the perspective of the "robot", demonstrating the tool-execution loop:

We use a `while` loop to execute the code logic that includes tool calls because the Kimi large language model typically doesn't make just one tool call, especially in the context of online searching. Usually, Kimi will first call the `search` tool to get search results, and then call the `crawl` tool to convert the URLs in the search results into actual web page content. The overall structure of the `messages` is as follows:

```text theme={null}
system: prompt                                                                                               # System prompt
user: prompt                                                                                                 # User's question
assistant: tool_call(name=search, arguments={query: query})                                                  # Kimi returns a tool_call (single)
tool: search_result(tool_call_id=tool_call.id, name=search)                                                  # Submit the tool_call execution result
assistant: tool_call_1(name=crawl, arguments={url: url_1}), tool_call_2(name=crawl, arguments={url: url_2})  # Kimi continues to return tool_calls (multiple)
tool: crawl_content(tool_call_id=tool_call_1.id, name=crawl)                                                 # Submit the execution result of tool_call_1
tool: crawl_content(tool_call_id=tool_call_2.id, name=crawl)                                                 # Submit the execution result of tool_call_2
assistant: message_content(finish_reason=stop)                                                               # Kimi generates a reply to the user, ending the conversation
```

This completes the entire process of making "online query" tool calls. If you have implemented your own `search` and `crawl` methods, when you ask Kimi to search online, it will call the `search` and `crawl` tools and give you the correct response based on the tool call results.

## Handle tool\_calls in Streaming Output

In streaming output mode (`stream`), `tool_calls` work as well, but there are a few extra things to note:

* During streaming output, since `finish_reason` will appear in the last data chunk, it is recommended to check if the `delta.tool_calls` field exists to determine if the current response includes a tool call;
* During streaming output, `delta.content` will be output first, followed by `delta.tool_calls`, so you must wait until `delta.content` has finished outputting before you can determine and identify `tool_calls`;
* During streaming output, we will specify the `tool_call.id` and `tool_call.function.name` in the initial data chunk, and only `tool_call.function.arguments` will be output in subsequent chunks;
* During streaming output, if Kimi returns multiple `tool_calls` at once, we will use an additional field called `index` to indicate the index of the current `tool_call`, so that you can correctly concatenate the `tool_call.function.arguments` parameters. We use a code example from the streaming output section (without using the SDK) to illustrate how to do this:

## Use tool\_calls Instead of function\_call

`tool_calls` evolved from function calls (`function_call`), and `function_call` is a subset of `tool_calls` — in certain contexts, or when reading compatibility code, you can treat the two as equivalent. Since OpenAI has marked `function_call` and related parameters (such as `functions`) as "deprecated", our API will no longer support `function_call`; use `tool_calls` instead. Compared to `function_call`, `tool_calls` has the following advantages:

* It supports parallel calls. The Kimi large language model can return multiple `tool_calls` at once. You can use concurrency in your code to call these `tool_call` simultaneously, reducing time consumption;
* For `tool_calls` that have no dependencies, the Kimi large language model will also tend to call them in parallel. Compared to the original sequential calls of `function_call`, this reduces token consumption to some extent;

## Notes

* When `finish_reason=tool_calls`, `message.content` is occasionally not empty: it is usually the Kimi large language model explaining which tools it needs to call and why. If your tool call process takes a long time, or a single turn requires several sequential tool calls, this descriptive message can reduce the anxiety or dissatisfaction users feel while waiting, and helps them understand the tool call flow and intervene and correct in time (for example, terminating an incorrect tool call, or correcting the model's tool selection with a prompt in the next turn);
* The content in the `tools` parameter is also counted in the total Tokens. Please ensure that the total number of Tokens in `tools` and `messages` does not exceed the model's context window size.

### Keep Every tool\_call Matched to a tool Message

In tool call scenarios, messages are no longer a simple alternation of `system` / `user` / `assistant`:

```text theme={null}
system: ...
user: ...
assistant: ...
user: ...
assistant: ...
```

Instead, they look like this:

```text theme={null}
system: ...
user: ...
assistant: ...
tool: ...
tool: ...
assistant: ...
```

When the Kimi large language model generates `tool_calls`, make sure every `tool_call` has a corresponding message with `role=tool`, and that this message carries the correct `tool_call_id`: if the number of `role=tool` messages does not match the number of `tool_calls`, an error will occur; likewise, if the `tool_call_id` in a `role=tool` message cannot be matched with the `tool_call.id` in `tool_calls`, an error will occur.

### Troubleshoot the tool\_call\_id not found Error

If you encounter the `tool_call_id not found` error, it may be because you did not add the `role=assistant` message returned by the Kimi API to the messages list. The correct message sequence should look like this:

```text theme={null}
system: ...
user: ...
assistant: ...  # <-- Perhaps you did not add this assistant message to the messages list
tool: ...
tool: ...
assistant: ...
```

You can avoid the `tool_call_id not found` error by executing `messages.append(message)` each time you receive a return value from the Kimi API, to add the message returned by the Kimi API to the messages list.

*Note: Assistant messages added to the messages list before the `role=tool` message must fully include the `tool_calls` field and its values returned by the Kimi API. We recommend directly adding the `choice.message` returned by the Kimi API to the messages list "as is" to avoid potential errors.*
