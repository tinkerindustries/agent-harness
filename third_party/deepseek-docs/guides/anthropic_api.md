# Using the Anthropic API

To meet the demand for using the Anthropic API ecosystem, our API has added support for the Anthropic API format, with the `base_url` being `https://api.deepseek.com/anthropic`.

With simple configuration, you can integrate the capabilities of DeepSeek into the Anthropic API ecosystem.

---

## Use DeepSeek in Claude Code

Please refer to [Integrate with Claude Code](../quick_start/agent_integrations/claude_code.md).

## Invoke DeepSeek Model via Anthropic API

1. Install Anthropic SDK

```text
pip install anthropic
```

2. Config Environment Variables

```text
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=https://api.deepseek.com/anthropic
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=${YOUR_API_KEY}
```

3. Invoke the API

```text
import anthropic

client = anthropic.Anthropic()

message = client.messages.create(
    model="deepseek-v4-pro",
    max_tokens=1000,
    system="You are a helpful assistant.",
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": [
                {
                    "type": "text",
                    "text": "Hi, how are you?"
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
)
print(message.content)
```

**Note:** When you pass an unsupported model name to DeepSeek's Anthropic API, the API backend will automatically map it to the `deepseek-v4-flash` model.

## Anthropic Model Mapping

When you use the Anthropic API, we map the Claude model names you pass in:

- Models starting with claude-opus are mapped to deepseek-v4-pro
- Models starting with claude-haiku or claude-sonnet are mapped to deepseek-v4-flash

With this mapping, when using the developer mode of the new Claude Desktop APP, you can bypass the APP's model name restrictions by simply changing the base_url and api_key to connect to DeepSeek models.
