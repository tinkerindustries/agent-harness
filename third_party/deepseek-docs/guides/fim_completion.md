# FIM Completion (Beta)

In [FIM (Fill In the Middle) completion](../api/create-completion.md), users can provide a prefix and a suffix (optional), and the model will complete the content in between. FIM is commonly used for content completion、code completion.

## Notice

1. The max tokens of FIM completion is 4K.
2. The user needs to set `base_url=https://api.deepseek.com/beta` to enable the Beta feature.

## Sample Code

Below is a complete Python code example for FIM completion. In this example, we provide the beginning and the end of a function to calculate the Fibonacci sequence, allowing the model to complete the content in the middle.

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    api_key="<your api key>",
    base_url="https://api.deepseek.com/beta",
)

response = client.completions.create(
    model="deepseek-v4-pro",
    prompt="def fib(a):",
    suffix="    return fib(a-1) + fib(a-2)",
    max_tokens=128
)
print(response.choices[0].text)
```

## Integration With Continue

[Continue](https://continue.dev) is a VSCode plugin that supports code completion. You can refer to [this document](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/awesome-deepseek-integration/blob/main/docs/continue/README_cn.md) to configure Continue for using the code completion feature.
