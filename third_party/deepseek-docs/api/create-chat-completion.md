          - `type` (string) **required** — Possible values: [file]. The type of the content part, in this case `file`.
          - `file_id` (string) — The ID of a file uploaded via the [Files API](../guides/files_api.md), of the form `file-api-...`. Mutually exclusive with `file_data`.
          - `file_data` (string) — A base64-encoded data URL of the image (`data:image/jpeg;base64,...`). Mutually exclusive with `file_id`.

    - `role` (string) **required** — Possible values: [assistant]. The role of the messages author, in this case `assistant`.
    - `name` (string) — An optional name for the participant. Provides the model information to differentiate between participants of the same role.
    - `prefix` (bool) — (Beta) Set this to `true` to force the model to start its answer by the content of the supplied prefix in this `assistant` message. You must set `base_url="https://api.deepseek.com/beta"` to use this feature.
    - `reasoning_content` (string) **nullable** — (Beta) Used for the thinking mode in the [Chat Prefix Completion](../guides/chat_prefix_completion.md) feature as the input for the CoT in the last assistant message. When using this feature, the `prefix` parameter must be set to `true`.
  - *oneOf* — Tool message
    - `role` (string) **required** — Possible values: [tool]. The role of the messages author, in this case `tool`.
    - `content` (Text content (string)) **required** — The contents of the tool message.
    - `tool_call_id` (string) **required** — Tool call that this message is responding to.
- `model` (string) **required** — Possible values: [deepseek-v4-flash, deepseek-v4-pro, deepseek-v4-flash-vision-exp]. ID of the model to use.
- `thinking` (object) **nullable** — Controls the switch between thinking and non-thinking mode.
  - `type` (string) — Possible values: [enabled, disabled]. Default value: enabled. If set to `enabled`, then use thinking mode. If set to `disabled`, then use non-thinking model.
- `reasoning_effort` (string) — Possible values: [low, high, max]. Controls the reasoning effort of the model. The default effort is `high`. For compatibility, `medium` and `xhigh` are mapped to `high`.
- `max_tokens` (integer) **nullable** — The maximum number of tokens that can be generated in the chat completion. The total length of input tokens and generated tokens is limited by the model's context length. For the value range and default value, please refer to the [documentation](../quick_start/pricing.md).
- `response_format` (object) **nullable** — An object specifying the format that the model must output. Setting to { "type": "json_object" } enables JSON Output, which guarantees the message the model generates is valid JSON. **Important:** When using JSON Output, you must also instruct the model to produce JSON yourself via a system or user message. Without this, the model may generate an unending stream of whitespace until the generation reaches the token limit, resulting in a long-running and seemingly "stuck" request. Also note that the message content may be partially cut off if finish_reason="length", which indicates the generation exceeded max_tokens or the conversation exceeded the max context length.
  - `type` (string) — Possible values: [text, json_object]. Default value: text. Must be one of `text` or `json_object`.
- `stop` (object) **nullable** — Up to 16 sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens.
  - *oneOf* — MOD1 — string
  - *oneOf* — MOD2 — string
- `stream` (boolean) **nullable** — If set, partial message deltas will be sent. Tokens will be sent as data-only server-sent events (SSE) as they become available, with the stream terminated by a `data: [DONE]` message.
- `stream_options` (object) **nullable** — Options for streaming response. Only set this when you set `stream: true`.
  - `include_usage` (boolean) — If set to `true`, all chunks in the stream will include a `usage` field, whose value is `null` on every chunk except the last one. If omitted or set to `false`, the `usage` field is absent from all chunks except the last one. Either way, the last chunk before the `data: [DONE]` message carries the token usage statistics for the entire request in its `usage` field. Note that no separate usage-only chunk is emitted: the statistics ride on the last content chunk, whose `choices` array always contains exactly one element that carries no new content and a non-null `finish_reason`.
- `temperature` (number) **nullable** — Possible values: <= 2. Default value: 1. What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic. We generally recommend altering this or `top_p` but not both.
- `top_p` (number) **nullable** — Possible values: <= 1. Default value: 1. An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered. We generally recommend altering this or `temperature` but not both.
- `tools` (object[]) **nullable** — A list of tools the model may call. Currently, only functions are supported as a tool. Use this to provide a list of functions the model may generate JSON inputs for. A max of 128 functions are supported.
  - `type` (string) **required** — Possible values: [function]. The type of the tool. Currently, only `function` is supported.
  - `function` (object) **required**
    - `description` (string) — A description of what the function does, used by the model to choose when and how to call the function.
    - `name` (string) **required** — The name of the function to be called. Must be a-z, A-Z, 0-9, or contain underscores and dashes, with a maximum length of 64.
    - `parameters` (object) — The parameters the functions accepts, described as a JSON Schema object. See the [Tool Calls Guide](../guides/tool_calls.md) for examples, and the [JSON Schema reference](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/) for documentation about the format. Omitting `parameters` defines a function with an empty parameter list.
      - `property name*` (any) — The parameters the functions accepts, described as a JSON Schema object. See the [Tool Calls Guide](../guides/tool_calls.md) for examples, and the [JSON Schema reference](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/) for documentation about the format. Omitting `parameters` defines a function with an empty parameter list.
    - `strict` (boolean) — Default value: false. If set to true, the API will use strict-mode for the tool calls to ensure the output always complies with the function's JSON schema. This is a Beta feature, for more details please refer to [Tool Calls Guide](../guides/tool_calls.md)
- `tool_choice` (object) **nullable** — Controls which (if any) tool is called by the model. `none` means the model will not call any tool and instead generates a message. `auto` means the model can pick between generating a message or calling one or more tools. `required` means the model must call one or more tools. Specifying a particular tool via `{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "my_function"}}` forces the model to call that tool. `none` is the default when no tools are present. `auto` is the default if tools are present.
  - *oneOf* — ChatCompletionToolChoice — string. **Possible values:** [`none`, `auto`, `required`]
  - *oneOf* — ChatCompletionNamedToolChoice
    - `type` (string) **required** — Possible values: [function]. The type of the tool. Currently, only `function` is supported.
    - `function` (object) **required**
      - `name` (string) **required** — The name of the function to call.
- `logprobs` (boolean) **nullable** — Whether to return log probabilities of the output tokens or not. If true, returns the log probabilities of each output token returned in the `content` of `message`.
- `top_logprobs` (integer) **nullable** — Possible values: <= 20. An integer between 0 and 20 specifying the number of most likely tokens to return at each token position, each with an associated log probability. `logprobs` must be set to `true` if this parameter is used.
- `user_id` **nullable** — A custom user_id. Allowed character set is [a-zA-Z0-9\-_], with a maximum length of 512. Do not include user privacy information in the user_id.
- `frequency_penalty` **deprecated** — This parameter is no longer supported. It will not take effect if you pass it to the API.
- `presence_penalty` **deprecated** — This parameter is no longer supported. It will not take effect if you pass it to the API.
