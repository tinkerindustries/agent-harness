(1) Use `deepseek-flash` as the model name. The legacy names `deepseek-v4-flash` and `deepseek-v4-flash-vision-exp` are still accepted, but the corresponding models have been retired, their requests are served by the DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash model and billed at the Flash price.

(2) After extensive testing, V4.1 Flash has comprehensively surpassed V4 Pro in performance, cost, speed, and total time, so we plan to retire V4 Pro in an orderly manner. From 12:00 Beijing Time on September 14, 2026, and until V4.1 Pro is released in the future, requests to `deepseek-v4-pro` will all be routed to V4.1 Flash and billed at the V4.1 Flash price.

(3) Off-peak rates are half of the peak rates. Peak hours are 01:00 - 04:00 and 06:00 - 10:00 UTC, Monday through Friday (all other hours are off-peak).

(4) For more details on concurrency limits, please refer to [Rate Limit & Isolation](rate_limit.md).

## Deduction Rules

The expense = number of tokens × price. The corresponding fees will be directly deducted from your topped-up balance or granted balance, with a preference for using the granted balance first when both balances are available.

Product prices may vary and DeepSeek reserves the right to adjust them. We recommend topping up based on your actual usage and regularly checking this page for the most recent pricing information.
