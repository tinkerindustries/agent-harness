# Integrate with GitHub Copilot

**DeepSeek V4 for Copilot Chat** is a VS Code extension that adds DeepSeek V4 Pro & Flash directly into the GitHub Copilot Chat model picker. You keep Copilot's agent mode, tool calling, skills, and MCP — all powered by DeepSeek.

#### 1. Install the Extension

- Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) 1.116 or later.
- Make sure you have a GitHub Copilot subscription (Free / Pro / Enterprise — the free tier works).
- Install the extension from the [Github repo](https://github.com/Vizards/deepseek-v4-for-copilot).

#### 2. Get a DeepSeek API Key

- Go to [DeepSeek Platform](https://platform.deepseek.com/api_keys) and create an API key.
- Copy the key (it starts with `sk-`).

#### 3. Configure the API Key in VS Code

- Open the Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P` / `Ctrl+Shift+P`).
- Run **DeepSeek: Set API Key** and paste your key.
- The key is stored securely in the OS keychain, never on disk.

#### 4. Select the Model and Start Chatting

- Open Copilot Chat (`Cmd+Shift+I` / `Ctrl+Shift+I`).
- Click the model picker at the top-right of the chat panel.
- Choose **DeepSeek V4 Pro** or **DeepSeek V4 Flash**.
- Start chatting — agent mode, tool calling, and all Copilot features work out of the box.

#### Optional: Configure Thinking Effort

In the model picker, click the gear icon next to a DeepSeek model to choose the thinking effort level:

- **None** — fastest, no reasoning.
- **High** — balanced (default).
- **Max** — deep reasoning for complex tasks.

#### Optional: Vision Support

DeepSeek V4 is text-only, but the extension handles images automatically. Drop a screenshot into chat and it proxies through another installed Copilot model (Claude, GPT-4o) to describe the image before sending to DeepSeek. Run **DeepSeek: Set Vision Proxy Model** to pick which model handles image descriptions.
